## 🔴 Who I Am (No Bullshit Version)

I am an **Offensive Security Engineer** focused on **real-world attack simulation**, not theoretical vulnerability scanning.

My work centers around:
- Turning **low-privileged access into full compromise**
- **Active Directory exploitation** and privilege escalation
- **Web application attack chains**, not isolated bugs
- Clear, professional **security reporting aligned with business risk**

I am not a tool-clicker.  
I focus on **attack paths, impact, and remediation** — the things companies actually pay for.

## 🎯 Core Offensive Capabilities

- **Penetration Testing**  
  Black-box and grey-box testing of web applications, internal networks, and enterprise environments.

- **Active Directory Attacks**  
  Kerberoasting, NTLM relay, pass-the-hash, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and domain compromise logic.

- **Web Application Security**  
  Authentication bypass, access control failures, injection vulnerabilities, file upload abuse, and logic flaws.

- **Privilege Escalation**  
  Linux and Windows privilege escalation through misconfigurations, weak permissions, and service abuse.

- **Security Reporting**  
  Translating technical findings into clear risk, impact, and remediation guidance for engineering and leadership teams.

## 🧠 How I Think About Security

I approach offensive security as **problem-solving**, not exploitation theater.

My methodology:
1. Understand the environment
2. Identify realistic attacker entry points
3. Chain weaknesses into meaningful impact
4. Demonstrate risk clearly
5. Help reduce the attack surface

If a finding cannot be explained or defended, it does not belong in a report.

## 📂 What You’ll Find in This GitHub

This GitHub is intentionally **clean and professional**.

You will find:
- 📁 **Red team notes** explaining attack logic and methodology  
- 📁 **Attack writeups** documenting full compromise paths in lab environments  
- 📁 **Small tools and scripts** built to support enumeration and analysis  

You will **not** find:
- Stolen exploits  
- Malware dumps  
- Client data  
- Illegal or unethical content  

Everything here is built for **learning, simulation, and defensive awareness**.

## 🧪 Labs & Continuous Practice

I continuously practice and validate techniques using:
- Controlled lab environments
- Active Directory simulations
- Web application testing labs
- Internal network attack scenarios

Every skill here is **tested, not memorized**.

---

## 🌍 Work Preference

- Remote-first roles  
- Offensive Security / Red Team / Penetration Testing  
- Consulting, MSSP, or product security teams  

I value:
- Clear scope
- Ethical engagement
- High-impact work

## ⚠️ Final Note

This profile represents **how I actually work**, not how I market myself.

If you’re looking for:
- Flashy exploits → look elsewhere  
- Realistic attack simulation → you’re in the right place
